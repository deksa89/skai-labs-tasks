# SKAI Labs Technical Tasks

## Introduction
Welcome to my solution repository for the technical tasks provided by SKAI Labs as part of the job candidate evaluation process. This repository shows my problem solving abilities and coding skills across these three tasks, each task is in its own folder.

## Tasks Overview

- **open_layer_app**: A `JavaScript` task with use of `OpenLayers` library to display polygon on the map
- **detecting_unauthorized_sales**: A web application developed using library called `Flask` whose goal is to detect unauthorized sales
- **job_interview_scheduling**: Another web application made by `Python` and `Flask` counts number of possible interviews a person can attend in given timeframes

## Installation and Running Instructions
To run the projects in this repository, you need to clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies for each task.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/deksa89/skai-labs-tasks.git
```
Navigate to the task folder you wish to run, and follow the instructions provided in the task's README.md.

## Approach and Solution Summary
All these tasks had their own specific difficulties that I had to overcome in order to solve them. 
They may seem short and easy on the first sight but to complete them fully, like I wanted, I had to change the approach and revise the code several times.
When it comes to Javascript task I wanted to make better user experience by adjusting the zoom to the polygon no matter what screen size do users use.
I also tried to cover all the errors that one might cause when sending incomplete or wrong data to the two Flask apps.
