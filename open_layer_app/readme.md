# Openlayers polygon mapping

**Open Layer App** is a web mapping application built with `OpenLayers`, a feature-packed library for creating interactive maps on the web.

I was using `npm create ol-app open_layer_app` to create the app to start building the project.
That command created a directory called `open_layer_app`, installed `OpenLayers`, `development server` and set up a basic app with `index.html`, `main.js`, and `style.css` files. 

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have `Node.js` (14 or higher) installed on your system. This project uses `npm` (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies.


### Installation
Clone the repository to your machine using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/deksa89/skai-labs-tasks.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd skai_labs_tasks/open_layer_app
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Running the application:
```
npm start
```

This command will start a local development server. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port indicated in your terminal) to view the application.


### Result
You will see the polygon encompasses northern Croatia with some spillover to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Zoom to polygon is adjusted to any screen size.
